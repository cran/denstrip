	*  Version 1.4 released 
	
2009-09-17 

	*  x and y limits in lattice plots taken from
	current.panel.limits() instead of trellis.last.object(), so 
	that it works when one axis shows factor levels.  Example
	of use of denstrip with "bwplot" added to help(denstrip). 
	Thanks to Kevin Wright for the suggestion.

	*  Examples using "Surv" changed for compatibility with new
	survival package in upcoming R 2.9.0.

	*  New argument "contour" to densregion.default to show contour
	lines of constant density value.

	*  Version 1.3 released

	*  cistrip now allows different "pch" for each element in a vector
	of strips.  Similarly, the point sizes can be varied with a "cex"
	argument.

	*  References updated to published version of the paper.

	*  Version 1.2 released.

	*  Code of the form seq(0, 1, length=n+2)[-c(1,n+2)] replaced by
	ppoints(n, a=0)

	*  Panel functions for all strips implemented for use with lattice
	graphics. Thanks to Austin Frank for the suggestion.

	*  Sectioned density plots can now point downwards or rightwards.

	*  Border drawn around lightest box in sectioned density plot.
	
	*  cex property added to denstrip.legend.

	*  User-specified axis ticks supported in denstrip.legend.
	
	*  default axis tick annotations in denstrip.legend now have 3
	significant figures instead of 2 decimal places.

	*  Eliminated dependency on R.utils by re-implementing
	seqToIntervals function in sectioned.density(). Thanks to Tobias
	Verbeke for the suggestion.
